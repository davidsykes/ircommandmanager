Graph data is contained in GraphDataSeries objects.
These are an array of GraphDataPoint objects, each with double x and y

Whenever a series is added to or removed from the collection to show the GraphSeriesExtentCalculator calculates the GraphSeriesExtent.
This is the top left right and bottom coordinates of a square that will contain all the series to plot


The graphSeriesExtent is the whole range of data values

The canvas width cw and height ch is the plotting area with 0,0 bottom left and width,height as right, top

The border is the proportion of the canvas around the edges that is to be kept clear. bw ranges from 0 to 1

The viewport is the portion of the data that is to be seen. 0,0 is left bottom, 1,1 is right top

A coordinate x is converted to a position along the extent from 0 left to 1 right

a = (x - el) / (er - el)

The viewport is expanded to fill the area 0,0 - 1,1

b = (a - vl) / (vr - vl)

and then scaled to the width of the area inside the drawing border

c = (b + bw) * (cw - bw*2)
