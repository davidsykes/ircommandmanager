Graph data is contained in GraphDataSeries objects.
These are an array of GraphDataPoint objects, each with double x and y

Whenever a series is added to or removed from the collection to show the GraphSeriesExtentCalculator calculates the GraphSeriesExtent.
This is the top left right and bottom coordinates of a square that will contain all the series to plot


The graphSeriesExtent is the whole range of data values
